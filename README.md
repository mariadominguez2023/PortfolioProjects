About

Hi, I'm Maria! I have an analytical background in Businnes Management and currently, I am on track to completing my MSc in Data Science (MS. Data Analytics). I have developed a strong foundation in the business accounting field and a passion for using data to uncover meaningful insights. I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the field of data science.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I am always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am driven by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex problems.
